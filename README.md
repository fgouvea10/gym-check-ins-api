# Gym Check-in App

This application was developed with the purpose of allowing gym check-ins in a simple and efficient way. To achieve this goal, I applied SOLID principles, Design Patterns, and Docker, as well as other technologies to ensure system security and scalability.
This application was developed using NodeJS, Typescript and Fastify.

## How to use the application

To use the application, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine;
2. Install Docker and Docker Compose, if you haven't done so already;
3. Run the docker-compose up command in the project root directory to start the database and the application;
